# ARM-SBC Linux Build Scripts

This repository contains scripts to automate the process of compiling **U-Boot**, the **Linux kernel**, and generating **bootable SD/eMMC images** for various ARM-based single board computers (SBCs), including Rockchip and Allwinner platforms.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arm-sbc/linux-build.git
cd linux-build
chmod +x arm_build.sh
./arm_build.sh
```

The script will guide you through selecting your board, SoC, kernel version, and desired build steps.

✅ Features
🧩 Interactive board selection for Rockchip and Allwinner

🛠️ Builds U-Boot, kernel, and optionally rootfs

⚙️ Applies patches and defconfigs automatically

💾 Creates bootable SD/eMMC images

🐧 Supports both legacy and mainline kernel options

🌐 Optional LXQt desktop setup with network auto-config

📦 Dependencies
All required build tools and packages will be installed automatically.
However, depending on your Linux distribution, you may need to install some packages manually, especially on non-Ubuntu systems.

⚠️ We recommend using Ubuntu 22.04 or newer for best compatibility.
